have something to do with the biases. 

My examples: 

* Confirmation bias - On every story, I try to say, “why is what I’m saying wrong? Who would disagree and why? Is there another way to look at this, or to analyze this data?”  I don’t have to change anything, but I need to DISPROVE my findings. And example on the data we worked on in examples: phoenix claims. I found that the police spend more than others. Why might that be wrong? If I changed the years I looked at , would the answer be different? If I excluded one large case, would the answer change? 

* survivorship bias - My Drybar example. But every dataset has a survivorship bias. 

Look at your medical examiner records - although no one survived, it is an example of survivorship bias. You only get into the database is someone decides you should - what about those who never get to it? 

And regression to the mean - look at any time you’ve thought about “the law of averages”, or any time you have written about a real outlier - something very strange that has happened. Things happen! They’re true, but they’re not necessarily meaningful. 

## Notes from last semester class

Budget writing: 
"While police, fire and other public safety grew by more than $102 million, the departments charged with helping families in need and the homeless grew by only $8 million, with a lower-than-average percent increase." 

et’s talk about these “questions” - and think about two types : The first type is questions you’d have to ask the government or experts, or to obtain other documents about. — What don’t you understand. 

The second is about process - how do they come up with these numbers, what does “human services” mean? 

Hypothesis: The homeless problem in Phoenix has steadily become more severe, and I expect that the category that deals with housing and human services would rise the fastest. Did they? 

 Short declarative sentence: Police, fire and other public safety departments continue to take up more than one-third of the city’s budget, while the category of spending that includes “human services” rose the slowest. 
NOTE: How you characterize the numbers, how you put things in a “compared to what” idea. 

Good short story
