This is the only graded group assignment we'll have throughout the semester. I'll assign the groups after Spring Break. 

The idea is that you will be assigned a beat, and you should brainstorm to find a story idea and at least two different datasets that might help tell that story. You will explain how you might use them. These have to be specific -- you must know they exist, and that they are easily available on the internet or public under public records law. 

Your group should submit the following: 

1. A story idea. Do as much research as it takes to develop a hypothesis about a problem. Avoid saying that you want to "look into {broad topic X}". 

Example hypothesis: The Maricopa County air quality inspectors don't enforce no-burn day restrictions, so people light fires on poor air quality days with impunity. 

2.  Describe at least two datasets that will help you tell this story, and how you would use them. Be specific. The datasets have to exist. Charts and graphs from reports done by research groups or the government do not count. Mentions of vague possibilities of a dataset that might exist doesn't count. We're talking real, tangible databases, like all the ones we've been using in class. 

Example: The Maricopa County air quality team has to track every time that they fine someone for having a fire on a restricted day. There's a dataset they keep in order to keep track of that. Columns include the name of person cited, their address, the amount of the fine and the date they were fined. I could use that to determine how frequently people get fined for having illegal files. 

The Maricopa County air quality team also collects complaints from all over the Valley. They have a dataset of complaints. Columns include the date the complaint came in, the address of the complainant, a description of the complaint and the time and date a county employee followed up on the complaint. I could see how many people are complaining -- and where -- and how that compares to the actual number of people fined. I could also see if the county employees are responding to the complaints within a reasonable time frame. 

I could also go a step further and analyze air quality in the valley over the years, using ADEQ air quality data. I can see a slice of that here: https://azdeq.gov/aq/ytd?location=phoenix&pollutant=pm25  so I know that the data exist. Using this would make my story stronger because then I could reference how the air quality in the Valley has fluctuated over the years. The county says that its no-burn-day rules has improved air quality because people have generally been following the rules. What do the stats say? 


3. Explain why the data exist, particularly paying mind to whether the data is required to be accurate or not. Explain any questions you have about the data's accuracy. 

4. Explain where the data come from. How would you get it? Does the data live online? Where do you find it? Would you have to file a state or federal public records request if it's not online? What agency would you have to request it from? And how would you phrase your request? (If the data are available online the questions about the request do not apply) 

--Example: I have to do a public records request for all of these. The Maricopa County complaints and enforcement data is not online. What I can see from ADEQ is only a slice of what I'm looking for. This is what I would ask for: 

* The county's database that tracks enforcement actions against people who violate the no-burn-day ordinance for the last five years. I want the following fields: name of the person breaking the rules, address, whether there was a fine, how much the fine was, date and time. I'd get this from Maricopa County Air Quality Control. 

* The county's database that tracks complaints coming from the public about people burning when they shouldn't for the last five years. I want the following fields: address of the complainant, address of the perpetrator, a description of the complaint, the date and time of the complaint and how the complaint was resolved.  I'd get this from Maricopa County Air Quality Control. 

* ADEQ's daily ozone Air Quality Index database for the last 20 years. I'd get the whole state and just narrow it down to Maricopa County if I needed to. I'd get this from ADEQ. 

*** You don't have to do any analysis! This is just the steps you would take before you did an analysis. ***

## Process

We'll start this in class by working on a strategy for finding data. This comes relatively late in the semester so that you understand what "data" is before you look for it. Don't get caught up trying to find "numbers". That's not the point -- we're looking for detailed, granular datasets like the ones we've been looking at all semester. Reports are only good to the extent that they reference their source data.

This is an exercise in doing background research to find data. You've done this in your investigative reporting class, but it may not have been specific to finding datasets. To find what documents and data are required in various departments, look for:

- Records retention schedules 
- Laws that regulate things. There's probably a dataset that tracks that the law is being enforced. You might have to call someone and double check the data exists. In the case of no-burn days, Caitlin McGlade figured that if there was an ordinance against burning, there had to be a system for tracking those who broke the ordinance. 
- Stories that have been published on your topic of interest and see what datasets they used.
- Research organizations that are involved with the topic you're working on and see if they've got any databases.  
- Research papers on your topic of interest written by academics to identify datasets that might exist.
- A good Google search, using all of the advanced methods. 
- Open government data portals. Phoenix has one (that's where calls for service data comes from). Mesa has one, Tempe does. Major cities typically have nice sites where you can download whole datasets on a variety of topics. Look in areas outside Arizona to see what other governments keep -- they're likely the same in different cities, even if they're not made public there.
- Go to the website of the agency that regulates whatever thing you're trying to write about and look for datasets that might be posted. 

There will be more resources on this to come.
