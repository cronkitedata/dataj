      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown a lot of links at you in the last couple of weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep updating this front page that puts them together, and will also pin them to the top of the #dj-sos and #dj-classroom Slack channels. If you need another way to get to them, I&amp;rsquo;m collecting them by month at https://bit.ly/dj2022-startme

      <description>This is just a reminder that attendng class by Zoom generally isn&amp;rsquo;t an option. Here is what the syllabus says about attendance:
 &amp;ldquo;There are no excused absences in this course, except for true medical or other emergencies or religious observances. You might decide it’s more important to schedule a job interview, attend a family event, or interview a source than to attend class or complete your work. If I were you, I might decide the same thing, but these are choices that reflect your priorities.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting here from time to time with important announcements, but you&amp;rsquo;ll hear everything first in Slack.
This site will give you most of what you need, but whenever there is a conflict between Canvas and this site, Canvas is the right one. Please alert me to conflicts, broken links or other mechanical issues as soon as possible via Slack. (Posting in #dj-sos Slack channel will ensure that everyone gets the answer, but you don’t have to.</description>
