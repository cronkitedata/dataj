      <description>Maybe stories are just data with a soul
 Brené Brown   I’ll use this structure to lay out weely agendas, upcoming deadlines, readings, tutorials and more. The full assignments are in Canvas in the modules by month.
Unless I suggest otherwise, you’re expected to have done more than just skimmed through or reviewed the material. You should read, watch or listen closely and try to follow along on all of the tutorials.</description>

      <description>Here’s a bit of writing advice I often share with students: engineers don’t look at a bridge the same way pedestrians or drivers do. The former understand the bridge as a language of angles and load bearing structures. Writers should read books in that same way.

      <description>data /ˈdeɪ.tə/ :
 information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer*, or information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making  Cambridge Dictionary -- almost*  * in reverse order
Some of this may feel abstract to you in the beginning but it will become more concrete as you start tackling datasets.
Agenda We have two days&#39; worth of work to do in only one class this week because of the MLK holiday.</description>

      <description>For the next couple of weeks, it may seem that we&amp;rsquo;ve left the world of reporting and investigative journalism. Most of your work and reading is focused on a getting you started in a programming language without interruption.
Generally, each day will go sort of like this:
 We&amp;rsquo;ll go over the work from the previous class, and probably have a lab. I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the new material in a demo, which you can follow along with (or not) You&amp;rsquo;ll then do after-class reading, which will make more sense once you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in action.</description>

      <description>Sarah Cohen  This is the poorly named website for my data journalism course at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School. It focuses on documents and data reporting in investigations.
I began teaching in Arizona in 2018 as the Knight Chair in Journalism. This is my second tour as a Knight chair – the first was at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, from 2009 to 2012.
I’ve been a reporter and editor for most of my career, starting out as a beat reporter in Florida covering health care, workplace issues and the local economy.</description>

      <description>The aim of this project is to identify and replicate the major findings from a story or series. It will be completed in three parts, which altogether accounts for 15 percent of your final grade.
How it works You&amp;rsquo;ll study the story and identify the key facts that derived from the primary dataset used. Then, over the course of a couple of weeks, you&amp;rsquo;ll try to replicate those findings using the R skills you will be learning in class.</description>
