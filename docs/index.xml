      <description>Maybe stories are just data with a soul
 Brené Brown   I’ll use this structure to lay out weely agendas, upcoming deadlines, readings, tutorials and more. The full assignments are in Canvas in the modules by month.
Unless I suggest otherwise, you’re expected to have done more than just skimmed through or reviewed the material. You should read, watch or listen closely and try to follow along on all of the tutorials.</description>

      <description>Here’s a bit of writing advice I often share with students: engineers don’t look at a bridge the same way pedestrians or drivers do. The former understand the bridge as a language of angles and load bearing structures. Writers should read books in that same way.

      <description>data /ˈdeɪ.tə/ :
 information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer*, or information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making  Cambridge Dictionary -- almost*  * in reverse order
Some of this may feel abstract to you in the beginning but it will become more concrete as you start tackling datasets.
Agenda We have two days&amp;rsquo; worth of work to do in only one class this week because of the MLK holiday.</description>

      <description>For the next couple of weeks, it may seem that we&amp;rsquo;ve left the world of reporting and investigative journalism. Most of your work and reading is focused on a getting you started in a programming language without interruption.
Generally, each day will go sort of like this:
 We&amp;rsquo;ll go over the work from the previous class, and probably have a lab. I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the new material in a demo, which you can follow along with (or not) You&amp;rsquo;ll then do after-class reading, which will make more sense once you&amp;rsquo;ve seen it in action.</description>

      <description>Agenda  Create your first markdown document An introduction to (some of) the verbs of the Tidyverse using Billboard top 100 hits.  Upcoming deadlines Wednesday 2/2
 Markdown lab  Sunday 2/6
 Billboard Top 100 introductory tutorial. Do the after-class reading before you tackle this. Get as far as you can in 3-4 hours of dedicated work. This exercise will give me guidance on where to spend our time, so it&amp;rsquo;s more important that you try to do this on your own than it is that you get the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; answer.</description>

      <description>This marks the beginning of collapsing each week&amp;rsquo;s work into one page on this website.
This week, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over some details of how to use the most common five verbs: select, arrange, mutate, summarise, group_by, and filter using a data source more likely to yield interesting stories: The Paycheck Protection Program loans for businesses and projects in Arizona.
EDIT: I changed the details of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing on Wednesday, when we&amp;rsquo;ll look closer at the filter verb and get an introduction to filtering without an exact match.</description>

      <description>This is our last week of basic verbs. With select, arrange, filter, summarise, group_by and now join , you&amp;rsquo;ll have most of what you need to analyze data in R! Next week we&amp;rsquo;ll start working to put it all into practice in a warm-up story memo project, and you&amp;rsquo;ll start seeing how to make your markdowns and data readable.
Agenda Monday Walkthrough on mutate and group_by/summarise. You&amp;rsquo;ll do the teaching!</description>

      <description>Agenda Monday   More on regular expressions - A lab that helps you understand more about what you are doing in the str_detect function in filtering and mutating - some of this will not be in R, but will be on a website that helps you write the patterns.
  Open lab to work on getting started on your replication project. While you may work together in labs to help one another get started, this is intended as an individual, not a team, project.</description>

      <description>From now on, you won&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of homework - most of your work will be either in-class labs or projects on your own, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of preparation for any classes. I&amp;rsquo;ll start listing in the agenda links to any presentations or other materials we use in class.

 Review the replication project as a whole. Intro to OpenRefine to clean data  Wednesday:
 Team lab: The Data Hunt. Finding and evaluating data on your beat on deadline. A guide to a data hunt is in the class textbook: Finding the right data for your story, and a template with an old example that won&amp;rsquo;t work anymore is in this google doc .

      <description>Sarah Cohen  This is the poorly named website for my data journalism course at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School. It focuses on documents and data reporting in investigations.
I began teaching in Arizona in 2018 as the Knight Chair in Journalism. This is my second tour as a Knight chair – the first was at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy, from 2009 to 2012.
I’ve been a reporter and editor for most of my career, starting out as a beat reporter in Florida covering health care, workplace issues and the local economy.</description>

      <guid>https://cronkitedata.github.io/dataj/coursedocs/builddb/</guid>
      <description>This is an assignment that challenges you to build a database out of documents or individual items that you collect yourself. I&amp;rsquo;m still deciding which documents to use for this, and will update it after Spring Break. We&amp;rsquo;ll do it partly in a lab, and then you&amp;rsquo;ll finish it up yourself in April.
If you have documents you want me to consider for this, please let me know.</description>

      <description>This assignment involves identifying one thing related to class that you’d like to apply or understand better, and produce an explainer around it. This could be a technique in R that you found confusing, something you decided to teach yourself because you found an interesting example, or a dataset that we didn’t really review in class that you’d like to explore. Run the idea by me before you put too much work into it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown a lot of links at you in the last couple of weeks. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep updating this front page that puts them together, and will also pin them to the top of the #dj-sos and #dj-classroom Slack channels. If you need another way to get to them, I&amp;rsquo;m collecting them by month at https://bit.ly/dj2022-startme

      <description>This is just a reminder that attendng class by Zoom generally isn&amp;rsquo;t an option. Here is what the syllabus says about attendance:
 &amp;ldquo;There are no excused absences in this course, except for true medical or other emergencies or religious observances. You might decide it’s more important to schedule a job interview, attend a family event, or interview a source than to attend class or complete your work. If I were you, I might decide the same thing, but these are choices that reflect your priorities.</description>

      <description>The aim of this project is to identify and replicate the major findings from a story or series. It will be completed in three parts, which altogether accounts for 15 percent of your final grade.
How it works You&amp;rsquo;ll study the story and identify the key facts that derived from the primary dataset used. Then, over the course of a couple of weeks, you&amp;rsquo;ll try to replicate those findings using the R skills you will be learning in class.</description>
