      <description>Maybe stories are just data with a soul
 Brené Brown   I’ll use this structure to lay out weely agendas, upcoming deadlines, readings, tutorials and more. The full assignments are in Canvas in the modules by month.
Unless I suggest otherwise, you’re expected to have done more than just skimmed through or reviewed the material. You should read, watch or listen closely and try to follow along on all of the tutorials.</description>

      <description>Here’s a bit of writing advice I often share with students: engineers don’t look at a bridge the same way pedestrians or drivers do. The former understand the bridge as a language of angles and load bearing structures. Writers should read books in that same way.

      <description>data /ˈdeɪ.tə/ :
 information in an electronic form that can be stored and used by a computer*, or information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making  Cambridge Dictionary -- almost*  * in reverse order
Some of this may feel abstract to you in the beginning but it will become more concrete as you start tackling datasets.
Agenda We have two days&#39; worth of work to do in only one class this week because of the MLK holiday.</description>

      <description>For the next couple of weeks, it may seem that we&amp;rsquo;ve left the world of reporting and investigative journalism. Most of your work and reading is focused on a getting you started in a programming language without interruption. Usually, I&amp;rsquo;ll provide a demo of the next class&amp;rsquo;s material before I ask you to tackle the reading and tutorials on your own.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it relevant.
Agenda  Install party!</description>
