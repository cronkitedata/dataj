This is an assignment that challenges you to build a database out of documents or individual items that you collect yourself. I'm still deciding which documents to use for this, and will update it after Spring Break. We'll do it partly in a lab, and then you'll finish it up yourself in April. 

If you have documents you want me to consider for this, please let me know.
