This assignment involves identifying one thing related to class that you’d like to apply or understand better, and produce an explainer around it. This could be a technique in R that you found confusing, something you decided to teach yourself because you found an interesting example, or a dataset that we didn’t really review in class that you’d like to explore. Run the idea by me before you put too much work into it.  DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT WILL TAKE MORE THAN ABOUT 3 HOURS. 

Some people call these projects “code-throughs”, which refer to writing up a technique or a tutorial using code. You can do this in a video, screencast or in an R Markdown project. You should get my approval if you want a different medium.

It's due the day we would have had a final exam, but I there is no reason to wait that long. Knock it out as soon as you have a good idea. 

## Examples

### The greatest twitter scheme!

My favorite example is more advanced than what I’d expect from you after just a few weeks of coding, but the idea is great. Garrick Aden Buie started when they noticed a tweet and wanted to know more:

That intrique spawned [this walthrough](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/greatest-twitter-scheme/) on the greatest twitter scheme ever. 

### Learning joins

Here is one from a former student on how joins work in R:

### Geolocation

And this is [an example](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/geolocation_sypher.html) of a student doing an explainer on geolocation (in a year that we had it in our course)


## How to choose a topic

You may choose anything we've touched on during the course. It might explain a technique you've found useful or it might apply a skill or piece of software that we've learned.  The main thing is to not make this too big of a project -- I hope it will take you no more than 3 hours.  Run your idea by me before you put significant work into it.
