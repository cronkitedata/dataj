This is just a reminder that attendng class by Zoom generally isn't an option. Here is what the syllabus says about attendance: 

>"There are no excused absences in this course, except for true medical or other emergencies or religious observances. You might decide it’s more important to schedule a job interview, attend a family event, or interview a source than to attend class or complete your work. If I were you, I might decide the same thing, but these are choices that reflect your priorities. They’re not emergencies, nor are they excused absences or deadlines."

However, no one wants you to come to school if you are infected with COVID or have another serious illness, or if you have been instructed to quarantine because of close contact with someone who has tested positive. Here is what to do if you're ill or in quarantine / isolation: 

* If you suspect you have COVID, or if you believe you have been exposed and should quarantine, you should contact the dean of students for instructions about what to do next. I can get verification for your absence from them.   If you test positive, I will work with you to help you keep up or catch up while you are not allowed to come to school. 
* If there is a true emergency, such as a car accident or a death in the family, please let me know as soon as possible and we'll work out what to do next. The same policy is in effect for religious observances. 
* If you are feeling sick, you should contact ASU Health Services or your doctor. I will need a doctor's note to extend any deadline or make accommodations for you.  

If it's not disruptive, I might be able to let you observe via Zoom, but you will not be able to participate. That means you won't be part of any group work and I won't be monitoring Zoom for questions or chat. It is often difficult to share my screen with Zoom and the class at the same time, and class will be the priority. Deadlines will stay in effect and you'll do the lab work on  your own. If you're too ill to work at home, I can extend a deadline after receiving the doctors' note or requests for accommodation from the dean of students. 

There are other times you may decide not to attend class -- you have something more important to do or you just don't feel 100%. You're adults and it's your decision. There is no direct affect on your grade - there is no longer a specific policy of reducing grades based on attendance.  However, it will be up to you to keep up or catch up. These are not "excused" absences, and you will not be offered the opportunity to observe via Zoom and deadlines for lab and home work will not be extended. 

Thanks for helping make this semester productive for everyone while living with COVID.
