I've thrown a lot of links at you in the last couple of weeks. I'll keep updating this front page that puts them together, and will also pin them to the top of the #dj-sos and #dj-classroom Slack channels. If you need another way to get to them, I'm collecting them by month at https://bit.ly/dj2022-startme

* The [boilerplate](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sarahcnyt/e60ad2d7ccf65498fc88791f3bb683ae/raw/bcf4fb844d183b62f531a74a445271c5571f3a1d/cronkite-boilerplate.Rmd) that you can use to replace the top of an R Markdown document with the options we usually want.  Copy and paste this into your markdown document, replacing the defaults, when you make a new one. 

*  The [start.me](https://bit.ly/dj2022-startme) page with all of the links we use in class. 

* The [Cronkite R Cheat Sheet](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/cronkite_cheat_v2.html) 

* The [list of sentences](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15nFfwZme3bJ0wBIrdn8Ptl3eshYfaQg1JbYd23XNnEg/edit?usp=sharing) to replicate, by story, and links to the datasets.
