Welcome to our newly revamped "Data Journalism" course for the masters' students in Cronkite's investigative reporting program. It’s time for your journey through what I’m calling “Empirical Journalism”, or the spine of many invstigative stories. I'm looking forward to a productive and lively semester! 

This site will give you most of what you need, but whenever there is a conflict between Canvas and this site, Canvas is the right one. Please alert me to conflicts, broken links or other mechanical issues as soon as possible [via Slack](https://asu-2217-jmc465-75289.slack.com/). (Posting in #dj-sos Slack channel will ensure that everyone gets the answer, but you don’t have to. )


Here's what I'm expecting when we start the semester:

* You have done the [first day's preparation](/weeks/week01-1/)
* You know how to do some very basic calcluations: percents, percent changes, sums, averages and medians - or you know how to look it up.
* You know your way around a spreadsheet, even if you’re not comfortable with them. Please review the [recording of my session from bootcamp](https://asu.zoom.us/rec/share/ScAhVxJe0Wd6E0D5j06K4BOe9RgI7RVMRvjZG98cSfcjUj7qngkWnta9Tocubw0w.yfem_P_WkY2iyBjQ) (passcode Fe+e5EL5 ) during the first week of class if you need a refresher.
