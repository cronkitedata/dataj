I'll be posting here from time to time with important announcements, but you'll hear everything first in Slack. 

This site will give you most of what you need, but whenever there is a conflict between Canvas and this site, Canvas is the right one. Please alert me to conflicts, broken links or other mechanical issues as soon as possible via Slack. (Posting in #dj-sos Slack channel will ensure that everyone gets the answer, but you donâ€™t have to. )


You have a few small things to do before we start class on Jan 10:

* [Reading / prep for the first day](/dataj/weeks/week01-1/)
* Revew some of the most common math found in newsrooms if you're unsure of yourself: percents, percent changes, sums, averages and medians. You can use these materials to remind yourself: 

  * Steve Doig's [cheat sheet](https://businessjournalism.org/2017/09/newsroom-math-crib-sheet/) (The short version but more than you need)
  * The [math review appendix](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-math.html) in our class "textbook" (The long version but only what you need)
