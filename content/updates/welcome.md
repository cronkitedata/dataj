Ready, set...
Dec. 15 2021

It’s time for your journey through what I’m calling “Empirical Journalism”, or the spine of many invstigative stories.

You have a little work to do before we get started. Some of it is simple – set up your Slack worksspace and fill out a survey. Some of it is remedial, depending on what you have done in the past or what you actually did in bootcamp. Before we get started, I have a few expectations:

You have set up your Canvas and Slack workspaces
You know how to do some very basic calcluations: percents, percent changes, sums, averages and medians. If you don’t have those methods memorized, you know where to find them.
You know your way around a spreadsheet, even if you’re not comfortable with them.
The organization of this site will give you what you need, but whenever there is a conflict between Canvas and this site, Canvas is the right one. Please alert me to conflicts, broken links or other mechanical issues as soon as possible via Slack. (Posting in #dj-sos Slack channel will ensure that everyone gets the answer, but you don’t have to. )
