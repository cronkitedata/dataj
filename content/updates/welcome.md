This site will give you most of what you need, but whenever there is a conflict between Canvas and this site, Canvas is the right one. Please alert me to conflicts, broken links or other mechanical issues as soon as possible via Slack. (Posting in #dj-sos Slack channel will ensure that everyone gets the answer, but you don’t have to. )


I'll be posting here from time to time with important announcements, but you'll hear everything first in Slack. 

When we gather on Jan. 10, here's what I expect you'll bring to class: 

* You have done the [first day's preparation](/weeks/week01-1/)
* You know how to do the most common math found in newsrooms: percents, percent changes, sums, averages and medians - or you know how to look it up.
* You know your way around a spreadsheet, even if you’re not comfortable with them. Please review the [recording of my session from bootcamp](https://asu.zoom.us/rec/share/ScAhVxJe0Wd6E0D5j06K4BOe9RgI7RVMRvjZG98cSfcjUj7qngkWnta9Tocubw0w.yfem_P_WkY2iyBjQ) (passcode Fe+e5EL5 ) during the first week of class if you need a refresher.
