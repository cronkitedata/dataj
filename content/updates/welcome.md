This site will give you most of what you need, but whenever there is a conflict between Canvas and this site, Canvas is the right one. Please alert me to conflicts, broken links or other mechanical issues as soon as possible via Slack. (Posting in #dj-sos Slack channel will ensure that everyone gets the answer, but you donâ€™t have to. )


I'll be posting here from time to time with important announcements, but you'll hear everything first in Slack. 

Here's what I expect of you when we gather on Jan. 10: 

* You have done the [first day's preparation](/dataj/weeks/week01-1/)
* You know how to do the most common math found in newsrooms: percents, percent changes, sums, averages and medians - or you know how to look it up.
