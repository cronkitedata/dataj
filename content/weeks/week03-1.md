## Preparation

### Tutorials

#### From the textbook

We went through all of this in the session in boot camp but it went by quickly and you never practiced. For some people, these will take some effort. For others, they're just review. Later in the semester I expect we'll all be closer to the same experience level, so bear with me for this week. 

* [An Excel Refresher](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-refresher.html) . 

* [Excel formulas]((https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-formulas.html))

* [Excel filter and sort](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-filter-sort.html)

* If you don't remember how to work with fractions, percents, etc., review the [Appendix A](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-math.html) to the course textbook

Once you've finished this, you'll be in good shape to do the homework due before class on Monday.
