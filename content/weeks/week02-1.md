## Learning materials

It may seem that we're taking a long time to get to the hands-on portion of the class. Have no fear, it will start soon. But much of the work in data reporting actually happens away from the keyboard. There are some important first steps before you dig into any dataset. 

### Understanding data and its integrity

We are using a bespoke online textbook I made that puts together and updates a lot of handouts and tutorials I've had scattered around various Canvas sites, Google Drive docs and Github repos. This isn't like a regular textbook - don't get too worried when you see several chapters. Many are less than 1,000 words.

### Reading and viewing

Just a few short items to illustrate the different kinds of data in the wild. 

* "[24 million Americans fear missing next rent payment as benefits dry up](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/07/24/24-million-americans-say-they-have-little-no-chance-being-able-pay-next-months-rent-eviction/5497764002/.)", USA Today, by Kevin Crowe, Theresa Diffendal, and Carlie Procell. July 2020.   The Census Bureau does a lot more than the every-10-year canvas that we're most familiar with. During the pandemic, for example, it's created an experimental survey of households and small businesses specifically to monitor how it's affecting Americans. Unlike the "digital trace data" you read about, this one was made for us to analyze.

* ["AP Finds Most Arrested in protests aren't leftist radicals"](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-suburbs-health-racial-injustice-7edf9027af1878283f3818d96c54f748) and "[A description of their analysis](http://leads.ap.org/best-of-the-week/analyzing-protest-arrest-records) , Oct. 30, 2020. A great example of developing a story from court records -- creating that "electronic form" of information that can then be analyzed in many different ways. Try to imagine what details the reporters chose to track and which ones they decided to ignore.  Compiling data by examining news stories and court records  are two very common ways that news organizations create data for analysis. They  have flaws but  they're often the best available source.

* *OPTIONAL via Canvas*:  A chapter from *[The Art of Access: Strategies for Acquiring Public Records](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Access-Strategies-Acquiring-Records/dp/1506380700/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0/141-5195764-7429116)*, by David Cullier and Charles N. Davis, 2nd edition (2018). In the chapter you have on Canvas, the authors lay out a method for tracing the life and times of a data collection. It's useful advice any time you start working with a dataset. The book is expensive, but it's a good addition to any U.S.-based investigative journalist's bookshelf.

## Going further

Here are some more examples of datasets coming from unexpected places: historical site lines, investigative files, and rap. 

[This documentary and report](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/environmental-racism-in-death-alley-louisiana) by the independent firm Forensic Architecture in partnership with RISE St. James on environmental racism in "death alley", Louisiana, is quite long. But it's a great example of the emerging form of open source investigations that use imaging, historical site lines and similar non-traditional data in service of a larger piece, often conducted by human rights investigators rather than journalists.   (I can't get the direct link to work. If it won't work for you, choose Investigations, and look for those in the United States. At this writing there were only two. )

["Locked up and left to die"](https://www.texasobserver.org/locked-up-and-left-to-die/) , by Michael Barajas and Sophie Novack, Texas Observer, Nov. 1, 2021, is based largely on an  ambitious attempts to catalog the contents of more than 400 investigative files on jail deaths.  (I worked with the authors as a mentor on this story through the Fund for Investigative Journalism.)


And a shoutout to this [incredible piece by The Wall Street Journal](http://graphics.wsj.com/hamilton/), tracing the roots of the lyrical signatures in *Hamilton* .
