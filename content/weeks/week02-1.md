Some of this may feel abstract to you in the beginning but it will become more important as you start tackling datasets. 

## Agenda

We have two days' worth of work to do in only one class this week because of the MLK holiday. I suggest getting started on it early. If possible, look ahead a week and get started on that as well. If you don't, this week will sneak up on you really quickly. 

* Reviewing what is "data"? 
* Lab - The life of a dataset warmup 
* Replication in data journalism and the data diary

## Upcoming deadlines

(All in Canvas)

Friday 1/21 
{.text-dark}

* The life of a dataset (50 points)
* Confirm your Excel installation 

Sunday, 1/23
{.text-dark}

* Census homework (refresher from boot camp). A link to the recording of the boot camp session is on the Canvas assignment.  You might want to do [some of the preparation for next week](/dataj/weeks/week03-1/) before  you tackle it if you're not confident in your spreadsheet skills. 

Friday, 1/28 
{.text-dark}

* Notice of Claims filter and pivot table (I hope to finish this during class but it might go a little long.) 

## Learning materials

It may seem that we're taking a long time to get to the hands-on portion of the class. Have no fear, it will start soon. But much of the work in data reporting actually happens away from the keyboard. There are some important first steps before you dig into any dataset. 

### From the textbook:

* [Newsroom math](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-math.html)

* [Defining Data](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-data-def.html):  Please watch the embedded video (but feel free to up the speed. He talks pretty slowly.)

* [Replication and the data diary](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-data-diary.html) 

* ["Basic steps in working with data"](https://datajournalism.com/read/handbook/one/understanding-data/basic-steps-in-working-with-data), the Data Journalism Handbook, Steve Doig, ASU Prof.

### Reading and viewing

* Listen to Rob Gebeloff from the New York Times talk about the difference between granular CDC data on infections and the summary data that was used by most reporters throughout the pandemic in The Daily's "[Counting the Infected](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-data-united-states.html)"  The Daily, July 8, 2020. (His part is the first 20 minutes or so. Pay particular attention to the part beginning at about 8:00 where he talks about the difference between aggregate and granular data, and what it takes to get the latter.)

And just few more *short* items to illustrate the different kinds of data in the wild. 

* "[24 million Americans fear missing next rent payment as benefits dry up](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2020/07/24/24-million-americans-say-they-have-little-no-chance-being-able-pay-next-months-rent-eviction/5497764002/.)", USA Today, by Kevin Crowe, Theresa Diffendal, and Carlie Procell. July 2020.   The Census Bureau does a lot more than the every-10-year canvas that we're most familiar with. During the pandemic, for example, it's created an experimental survey of households and small businesses specifically to monitor how it's affecting Americans. Unlike the "digital trace data" you read about, this one was made for us to analyze. 

  I'll never understand the USA Today firewall. This doesn't appear to be in any of the services ASU library subscribes to, so [here's a pdf of the page](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/usatoday-crowe-rentpayments-covid.pdf) if you can't get to it.


* ["AP Finds Most Arrested in protests aren't leftist radicals"](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-race-and-ethnicity-suburbs-health-racial-injustice-7edf9027af1878283f3818d96c54f748), By Alanna Durkin Richer, Colleen Long and Michael Balsamo, October 2020. Also:  "[AP methodology](http://leads.ap.org/best-of-the-week/analyzing-protest-arrest-records) , Oct. 30, 2020. A great example of developing a story from court records -- creating that "electronic form" of information that can then be analyzed in many different ways. Try to imagine what details the reporters chose to track and which ones they decided to ignore.  Compiling data by examining news stories and court records  are two very common ways that news organizations create data for analysis. They  have flaws but  they're often the best available source.

## Going further

Here are some more examples of datasets coming from unexpected places: historical site lines, investigative files, and rap. 

[This documentary and report](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/environmental-racism-in-death-alley-louisiana) by the independent firm Forensic Architecture in partnership with RISE St. James on environmental racism in "death alley", Louisiana, is quite long. But it's a great example of the emerging form of open source investigations that use imaging, historical site lines and similar non-traditional data in service of a larger piece, often conducted by human rights investigators rather than journalists.   (I can't get the direct link to work. If it won't work for you, choose Investigations, and look for those in the United States. At this writing there were only two. )

["Locked up and left to die"](https://www.texasobserver.org/locked-up-and-left-to-die/) , by Michael Barajas and Sophie Novack, Texas Observer, Nov. 1, 2021, is based largely on an  ambitious attempts to catalog the contents of more than 400 investigative files on jail deaths.  (I worked with the authors as a mentor on this story through the Fund for Investigative Journalism.)

And a shoutout to this [incredible piece by The Wall Street Journal](http://graphics.wsj.com/hamilton/), tracing the roots of the lyrical signatures in *Hamilton*
