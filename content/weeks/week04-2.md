## Preparation & learning materials

### For today 

* [A gentle introduction to programming](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-program.html). Think about how you'd make an algorithm for a routine daily chore. You don't have to turn anything in, but we'll discuss in class. 
* Review [Getting Started with R And RStudio](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-start.html). We will have covered this chapter in class on Monday, but it's worth taking another look. If you haven't already, please create the master folder on your computer and set up your project. 
* Read [R Markdown](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-markdown.html). We will create that document in class today, but please read it so you are oriented to what we'll be doing . 


### After class learning materials

- [Getting and saving data](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/r-data-import.html) 
- *The Verbs of the tidyverse (link tk)*
