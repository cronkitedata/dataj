I’ll use this structure to lay out weely agendas, upcoming deadlines, readings, tutorials and more.  The full assignments are in Canvas in the modules by month.  

Unless I suggest otherwise, you’re expected to have done more than just skimmed through or reviewed the material. You should read, watch or listen closely and try to follow along on all of the tutorials.

## Agenda

* Introductions - you and me
* Review of surveys and goals for the semester
* Syllabus lab
* Empirical reporting: A project walkthrough
* Upcoming deadlines <br> (Everything will be due in Canvas, unless it says otherwise. )

## Upcoming deadlines

Sunday 1/9
{.text-dark}

* [Survey of skills](https://forms.gle/9eub49FvEbkdYaMY8) and interests via Google drive. You must sign into Google Docs using your ASU email to get access - I can't give access outside of the university for this one.

* Sign into the [Slack account for the class](https://asu-2221-mco510-23712.slack.com/). You should be automatically added to ```#dj-announcements```, ```#dj-sos``` and ```#dj-classroom``` , but make sure these are in your channel list.  Go to the Canvas assignment in the modules area under "January" and put your user name into the text box to let me know that you've completed this. (This is more important than it sounds. There are a lot of common names out there, and I've sent messages to the wrong people once or twice.)

Friday, 1/13
{.text-dark}
* Cronkite Academic Integrity pledge in Canvas

Tuesday, 1/17
{.text-dark}

* First try on numeracy assessment. The Canvas quiz will be released once you do the Cronkite Integrity pledge. You'll get two tries, and it has to be done by the end of the month. 

## Preparation & learning materials

### Reading / viewing

* [Syllabus](/dataj/syllabus/) and [schedule](/dataj/schedule). Be prepared to bring questions, comments or complaints to class on Monday.
 
* Welcome from Ron Nixon, global investigations editor, Associated Press

### Setting up Slack

We’re going to be using Slack for most of our communications during this class. It’s now the de facto communication tool in every newsroom (including the Howard Center, News 21 and Cronkite News) so you’ll have to get used to it at some point. 


Slack is an official ASU application. Don't do anything in Slack that you wouldn't in your ASU email or on ASU Zoom.

## Going further
Sometimes, I’ll put some links on this page as a way to go beyond what was required. There aren’t any for today.
