I’ll use this structure to lay out 1) class outlines, 2) key deadlines for this and the upcoming week, 3) Preparation required before class begins, including reading and tutorials.

Unless I suggest otherwise, you’re expected to have done more than just skimmed through or reviewed the material. You should read, watch or listen closely and follow along on all of the tutorials.

## Agenda

* Introductions - you and me
* Review of surveys and goals for the semester
* Syllabus lab
* Empirical reporting: A project walkthrough
* Upcoming deadlines <br> (Everything will be due in Canvas, unless it says otherwise. )

## Upcoming deadlines

### Sunday 1/9

* Survey of skills and interests via Google drive.

* Sign into the Slack account for the class and join #dj-announcements, #dj-sos and #dj-classroom, along with any other channels you might want to monitor. Go to Canvas and put your user name into the text box to let me know that you've completed this. (This is more important than it sounds. There are a lot of common names out there, and I've sent messages to the wrong people once or twice.)

### Friday, 1/13

* Cronkite Academic Integrity pledge in Canvas

### Sunday, 1/15

* First try on numeracy assessment (see syllabus)

## Preparation & learning materials

### Reading / viewing

* Syllabus and schedule. Be prepared to bring questions, comments or complaints to class on Monday.

* Welcome from Ron Nixon, global investigations editor, Associated Press

* The Journalistic Method: Five principles for blending analysis and narrative, by Nicholas Lemann, former dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

### Setting up Slack

We’re going to be using Slack for most of our communications during this class. It’s now the de facto communication tool in every newsroom (including the Howard Center, News 21 and Cronkite News) so you’ll have to get used to it at some point.

If you prefer, here’s an [ASU-specific training course for students](https://rise.articulatse.com/share/akWX1-IRl6dsbEPHlaHPXcFoe_AlAnXS#/) with the same information.


## Going further
Sometimes, I’ll put some links on this page as a way to go beyond what was required. There aren’t any for today.
