## Learning materials

### Reading and viewing

American journalists have been using empirical methods since the birth of the Republic. Read and watch these materials with an eye for the methods they describe -- data collection, counting and analyzing -- and the sources they used.

[Ida B. Wells used data journalism to fight lynching](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8979771/ida-b-wells-lynching-data), Dara Lind, Vox.com, July 2015


[The Myth of the Machine](https://cronkitedata.github.io/cronkite-docs/assets/docs/berens_nerds_words.pdf) Michael J. Berens, a chapter in "When Nerds and Words Collide" Poynter Institute, 1999. Although it was written more than 20 years ago, the insights are still relevant today.


[Introduction to Precision Journalism](https://asu.instructure.com/courses/107641/files/42496349/download?wrap=1), Sage Encyclopedia of Journalism, and [video of Philip Meyer](https://investigatingpower.org/philip-meyer/), who coined the term "precision journalism" in the late 1960s to refer to the use of social science research methods in journalism.

### Prepare for Wednesday's lab

This lab is geared at learning how to read and view journalism as a writer and producer, by closely examining HOW a story was conceived and executed rather than whether you liked it or thought it was "good". This is designed to orient you toward the "reporting" part of the data reporting equation.

* Chapter 1, Course textbook: Reading like a writer. Generally, when I assign these textbook chapters, you are not required to study the works listed in the additional reading or exercise sections unless I specifically assign them. 

* "[The Disproportionate Risk of Driving While Black](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html)", Sharon LaFraniere and Andrew Lehren, New York TImes, October 2015. We'll review this story in a group exercise on Wednesday, so be sure to review it fully. Pay attention to the data sources, the way that they were analyzed, and the writing and graphics, and the examples used. If great journalism is "the selection, not the compression, of facts," then think about how those facts and examples might have been found and why they were selected. After class, I'll provide an annotated version that goes through some of the sources and questions.  

### Self-help for the numeracy quiz

We're not going to review newsroom math in class. It's up to you to make sure that you have a handle on the basic computations that we all have to do in a newsroom or in life. The quiz will be 10 questions, released to you once you sign your Cronkite Integrity Pledge. You're permitted to use these materials during the test, but you are NOT allowed to Google the answers. (That's why you have to do the integrity pledge first.) You can take the quiz twice, and you must pass it before the end of the month. 

Be careful about picking out advice from random Google results on this topic - in searching for some resources for you, I found many that were just wrong. 

* Chapter 2 of the course textbook provides some of the key formulas that you need. It's an adaptation of a handout I made years ago that formed the basis of a book. 

* That book is called "Numbers in the Newsroom".  There is a copy of the full book in Canvas. Here is a [shorter tip sheet](/datadocs/danger.pdf) that goes through  much of the math that will be on the quiz. 

* [Newsroom Math Cribsheet](https://businessjournalism.org/2017/09/newsroom-math-crib-sheet/), by Steve Doig, used in Cronkite's undergraduate program. 

* A [nearly decade-old recorded lecture](https://youtu.be/0dforsRs8ZE) for a class I taught at Columbia University.
