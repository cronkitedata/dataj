## Learning materials

### Reading and viewing

American journalists have been using empirical methods since the birth of the Republic. Read and watch these materials with an eye for the methods they describe -- data collection, counting and analyzing -- and the sources they used. You're not expected to follow links or watch related material unless I mention them. 

* [The Journalistic Method: Five principles for blending analysis and narrative](https://journalistsresource.org/tip-sheets/journalistic-method-tip-sheet-blending-analysis-narrative/), by Nicholas Lemann, former dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

* [Ida B. Wells used data journalism to fight lynching](https://www.vox.com/2015/7/16/8979771/ida-b-wells-lynching-data), Dara Lind, Vox.com, July 2015

* [The Myth of the Machine](https://cronkitedata.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/docs/berens_nerds_words.pdf) Michael J. Berens, a chapter in "When Nerds and Words Collide" Poynter Institute, 1999. Although it was written more than 20 years ago, the insights are still relevant today.

* [Introduction to Precision Journalism](https://cronkitedata.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/docs/precision-journalism.pdf), Sage Encyclopedia of Journalism. 

### Prepare for Wednesday's lab

This lab is geared at learning how to read and view journalism as a writer and producer, by closely examining HOW a story was conceived and executed rather than whether you liked it or thought it was "good". This is designed to orient you toward the "reporting" part of the data reporting equation.

* [Learn a New Way to Read](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-story.html) from our course textbook site. When I assign these chapters, you are not required to study the works listed in the additional reading or exercise sections unless I specifically assign them. 

* "[The Disproportionate Risk of Driving While Black](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/25/us/racial-disparity-traffic-stops-driving-black.html)", Sharon LaFraniere and Andrew Lehren, The New York Times, October 2015. We'll review this story in a group exercise on Wednesday, so be sure to review it fully. Pay attention to the data sources, the way that they were analyzed, the writing and graphics, and the examples used. If great journalism is what some authors call the selection, not the compression, of facts, then think about how those facts and examples might have been found and why they were selected. After class, I'll provide an annotated version that goes through some of the sources and questions.  

### Self-help for the numeracy quiz

We're not going to review newsroom math in class. The quiz will be 10 questions, released to you once you sign your Cronkite Integrity Pledge. You're permitted to use these materials during the test, but you are NOT allowed to Google the answers -- that's why you have to do the integrity pledge first. You can take the quiz twice, and you must pass it before the end of the month. 

In genearl, be careful about picking out advice from random Google results. When I was searching for some resources for you, I found many that were just wrong. 

* [Appendix A of the course textbook](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-math.html) provides all of the key formulas that you need, shortened from chapter of "Numbers in the Newsroom", a book I wrote many years ago and is still sold by IRE. There is a free copy for ASU students in Canvas, but you don't need to use it.   

* [Newsroom Math Cribsheet](https://businessjournalism.org/2017/09/newsroom-math-crib-sheet/), by Steve Doig, used in Cronkite's undergraduate program. 

## Going further

Both of these are pretty expensive, but I'm listing them here in case you want to try to find them in a library. (ASU has neither one.) 

* One really good book for learning to write complicated stories in a variety of ways is William Blundell's "[Art and Craft of Feature Writing](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B001KDWGWQ)" . Although it's old, it has some great tips on writing with data. 

* Philip Meyer's "[Precision Journalism](https://www.amazon.com/Precision-Journalism-Reporters-Introduction-Science/dp/0742510883/)" is a staple on many data journalists' bookshelf. ASU library's version isn't the most recent.
