## Agenda

* Discuss reading
* Lab: Phoenix notice of claims data ([Details here](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-practice-noc.html))



## Upcoming deadlines

Friday, 1/28 
{.text-dark}
* Notice of Claims filter and pivot table (I hope to finish this in the lab, but it might go a little long. It's good practice for this weekend's test anyway) 

Sunday, 1/30
{.text-dark}
* Spreadsheet assessment . This won't be hard if you've been keeping up. You don't even turn in a spreadsheet! Instead, you'll be asked to look at a dataset of inspections and describe the steps you'd take to answer some questions.  We can discuss this at the beginning or end of class.  

Monday 1/31
{.text-dark}
* Final deadline for numeracy quiz. The dean will be informed if you haven't finished it by now. 

## Preparation

### Tutorials

* Follow along with the video below  [with a copy of the dataset](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/xlfiles/skittles.xlsx)

* Then follow along with the tutorial on [pivot tables from the textbook](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-pivot.html) . (Yes, we went a little out of order, but I wanted to make sure we spent a whole day on this.)

### Reading

* [Philandro Castile's Last Night: Tacos and Laughs, then a Drive](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/us/philando-castile-minnesota-police-shooting.html) ,  the New York Times, Mitch Smith with contribution from Robert Gebeloff, July 12, 2016. Look for how the data on police stops is used in the middle of the story.
