## Upcoming deadlines

Friday, 1/28 
{.text-dark}
* Notice of Claims filter and pivot table (I hope to finish this in the lab, but it might go a little long. It's good practice for this weekend's test anyway) 

Sunday, 1/30
{.text-dark}
* Spreadsheet assessment . This won't be hard if you've been keeping up. You don't even turn in a spreadsheet! Instead, you'll be asked to look at a dataset of inspections and describe the steps you'd take to answer some questions.  We can discuss this at the beginning or end of class.  

Monday 1/31
{.text-dark}
* Final deadline for numeracy quiz. The dean will be informed if you haven't finished it by now. 

## Preparation
