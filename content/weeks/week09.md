description: Visualizing data is a whole 'nother skill, but we can borrow from the design and statistics world to help make our reporting more efficient. Don't worry about style here -- think about whether you'll be able to "see" a story easier in infographic form than in numbers.

From now on, you won't have a lot of homework - most of your work will be either in-class labs or projects on your own, so you don't have a lot of preparation for any classes. I'll start listing in the agenda links to any presentations or other materials we use in class. 

## Agenda

### Monday 3/14


- [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JV8jIOEKodAc7KNZsr8aFhmv2sKkCHXFeYvVQjcbALE/edit?usp=sharing) on visualization as a reporting tool
- [Knight Center's online course](https://journalismcourses.org/course/data-visualization-for-storytelling-and-discovery/) on visualization from Alberto Cairo 
- [Example R Markdown on disasters compiled for reporters in News 21](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/A4-fema-summaries.html). This is just an example of how an analysis can be used with visualizations to help reporting in a team. 
- [Example of a one-time use graphic](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/county_delinquency.pdf), with little explanation. I'll explain it in class, and why it was so useful for a total of 10 minutes. This is [another example of a graphic used by reporters for selecting locations](https://cronkitedata.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/reveal_metro_area_master.html) in the PPP story from Reveal.
