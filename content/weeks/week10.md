description: You've seen it's hard to fix little mistakes in R, and that we don't have a good set of tools to it in Excel. Enter [OpenRefine](https://operefine.org), a small little program you put on your computer that is designed to help find and fix inconsistencies and difficult problems in your data. We'll also touch on extracting data from PDFs.

## Preparation & learning materials

If you want to follow along in class, you can either use the computers in the lab, or install [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/download.html) on your computer -- it doesn't take up much space. Just unzip it and drag it into your applications or anywhere else you want to launch it from. I'm by no means an expert in using this, but it's invaluable for fixing city names and standardizing company names. (Windows folks: Use the "Windows kit with embedded java". )

I'll have a chapter in the textbook on it by the time we get to this section.
