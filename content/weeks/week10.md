## Reading and agenda by class date

### Monday April 4

* "A drumbeat of multiple shootings, but America isn't listening" , by Sharon LaFraniere , Daniela Porat  and Agustin Armendariz, New York Times, May 2016. NOTE: Daniela will be a guest speaker on April 6 so be sure to read it carefully. 

* Textbook chapter : "Building your own database", which will be copied from an [older version](https://cronkitedata.github.io/cronkite-docs/general/09-build-own.html). It's the same material - I just haven't integrated it into the textbook yet. 

* Sign into Airtable - we'll do a tutorial on it on Monday. Be sure you know how to sign in. 

### Wednesday April 20

I'm thinking of moving the ethics day to April 20, so that you don't have a lot of reading the same weekend your memo is due. I'll list the reading here. 


## Preparation & learning materials

I'll add to the textbook as we go along, but here is some software you might want to install if you want to play along on your own laptop. All of it is installed in the classroom, so don't do this if you don't want to:

* OpenRefine
* QGIS
