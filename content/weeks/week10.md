## Reading and agenda by class date

### Monday, April 4

* Textbook chapter : "[Building your own database](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/start-build-own.html)"

* Sign into Airtable - we'll do a tutorial on it on Monday. Be sure you know how to sign in. 

* Re-review the chapter in the textbook on "[A gentle introduction to programming](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/appendix-program.html)". We're going to introduce looping on Monday, which is exemplified by the restaurant example. 


### Wednesday April 6

We'll be joined by Daniela Porat, senior reporter for Law360 covering employment law, who has been building databases for her stories since she began her reporting career in 2016. Read a couple of her examples (or watch the second one while she shivers in front of the Niagara River).

* "A drumbeat of multiple shootings, but America isn't listening" , by Sharon LaFraniere , Daniela Porat  and Agustin Armendariz, New York Times, May 2016. NOTE: Daniela will be a guest speaker on April 6 so be sure to read it carefully. 

* "[Training , equipment deficient in Police Drowning](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.investigativepost.org/2018/02/13/training-equipment-deficient-in-police-drowning/)", Daniela Porat, Investigative Post and WGRZ in Buffalo. A little context : The Niagara River feeds into Niagara Falls just a short distance from where the police officer drowned -- those rapids are among most dangerous in the world. Everyone in their audience already knows that. 


### Wednesday April 20

I'm thinking of moving the ethics day to April 20, so that you don't have a lot of reading the same weekend your memo is due. I'll list the reading here. 




## Recommendations for going further 

### OpenRefine

People who work in digital humanities, such as historians or experts in literature, often need to do many of the data cleaning chores that reporters do. That community has taken to OpenRefine, and there are a ton of good tutorials in that space. Here are a few: 

* [UCLA's Digital Humanities 201 course](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w19/tutorials-guides/data-cleaning-and-manipulation/getting-started-with-openrefine/) , by Miriam Posner
* Digital humanities OpenRefine lesson from [Data Carpentry](https://data-lessons.github.io/dh-openrefine/)


### Scraping

Try doing a couple of the other tutorials listed in the textbook. Also, when you sign up for your free DataCamp account, you'll see some assignments from me. The two that relate to scraping are particularly good.
