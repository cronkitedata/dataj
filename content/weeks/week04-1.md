For the next couple of weeks, it may seem that we've left the world of reporting and investigative journalism. Most of your work and reading is focused on a getting you started in a programming language without interruption. Usually, I'll provide a demo of the next class's material before I ask you to tackle the reading and tutorials on your own. 

I'll try to keep it relevant.
