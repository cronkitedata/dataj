The schedule is subject to change as we discover where you need or want more time on subjects. I may move some of the graded assignment to take a break from coding mid-semester. 

Expect to have other assignments and labs due every week. This just lists those that have points associated with them or are particularly important. 

I encourage you to do the "explainer" assignment (50 points) as soon as you come across something in class that you want to do. The final deadline is May 2, the date of the final exam period.
